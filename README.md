# ROKK3 BACKEND

## Use

1. Run MongoDB
2. Download or Clone the repository
3. Inside the project make:  ```npm install```
4. And then: ```npm start```

If all is OK then in console will appear a message: Success connection to Mongo!
Note: Make sure the port 3000 isn't busy , because the backend and frontend use this port.
